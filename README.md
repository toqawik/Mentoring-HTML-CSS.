Dedicated Data Analyst with a strong analytical mindset and proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, seeking to leverage data-driven insights for informed decision-making in a collaborative and dynamic work environment.

I graduated from Astana IT University with a degree in Big Data Analysis. I worked as a data analyst for a Canadian healthcare company and currently work for KazMunayGas. I did projects on analytics for system electronic documentation, access control systems, and SKStore (закупки КМГ) using Power BI and Qlik Sense.
